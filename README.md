The AI Powered Education Guidance System was inspired by the growing need for personalized and adaptive learning solutions in the education sector and especially in the industry sector as there is a gap between what skills the industry needs and what the students learn in college. There was a need for a system which uses AI for tailoring to personal needs and also only consists of all the free resources from across the web so that it can help students from all economic background. The inspiration was to use AI and ML for good and free of cost.
